# Kwok Provider

Before using the kwok provider, make sure that you don't have an installed version of Karpenter in your cluster. 

To install, you'll need a repository to push and pull images from. 

To use the kwok provider, you'll need to first run `make install-kwok`. 
Then run `make apply`, and then you should be good to go.
